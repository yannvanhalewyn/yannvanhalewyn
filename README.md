## Hey There, Let's Build Cool Stuff Together! 🚀

Hey devs, product people and musicians! 👋 Are you on the lookout for a passionate software engineer and product developer to solve some problems? Well, look no further! I'm here and ready to dive into the world of innovative product development with you. 🛠️

### About Me 🎸
---

I'm a self thought software developer with 8+ years experience, 5+ are writing Clojure. Besides crafting code, I'm also have ambitions in the arts of music and am looking to combine both passions in a personal project.

#### Brightmotive: B2B carparts made easy 🚗

I spent over 5 years at Brightmotive ([www.brightmotive.com](https://www.brightmotive.com)), diving deep into APIs, databases, and microservice architectures but running in a monolith, because who wants to manage such an infrastructure! We aimed for a seamless user experience and made a great international product fueled by a shared love of building beautuful things.

#### Pilloxa: making people healthier through technology 💊

In the world of Medicinal Technologies, I later spent 1.5 years at Pilloxa ([www.pilloxa.com](https://www.pilloxa.com)) leveraging React Native for developing an iOS and Android application that along with some hardware / bluetooth wizardry was aimed at helping patients in support programs and clinical trials stay healthy. 📱

### Keeping it Playful 🎨

But hey, it's not all serious code and debugging. Check out Boyscout, a pathfinding visualizer I whipped up. Take it for a spin here: [Boyscout Visualizer](https://yannvanhalewyn.github.io/boyscout/). (Use on laptop screen, not responsive)

Oh, and tap the Boyscout logo for a neat surprise. A taste of my creativity and attention to detail!

### Open Source 🏛

I've have developed and open sourced [Pottery](https://github.com/brightin/pottery), an open-source library to leverage industry-standard PO translation files from Clojure.
