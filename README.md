# Hi, I'm Yann üëã

**Let's Build Cool Things Together! üöÄ**

Passionate about product development, I offer a wide spectrum of knowledge, experience and skills. From infrastructure to UI/UX, from conception to released product, I provide value every step of the way.

I love untangling complexity to create simple solutions that just work. For me the best code isn't just functional, it feels right to use. I bring genuine empathy and intuition to every project, always thinking about the real people on the other side of the screen and how I can make their day a little easier.

# üíº Experience

I'm a self-taught software developer with 10 years experience, 8+ were spent writing **Clojure / Clojurescript** as I believe this to be the best tool for many jobs. Besides that I have worked in just about any modern tech stack:

# üåê Open Source

I've developed and open sourced several tools to solve real developer problems:

## Pottery

üîó [github.com/brightin/pottery](https://github.com/brightin/pottery)

An open-source library to leverage industry-standard PO translation files from Clojure.

## PrStack

*VCS-agnostic CLI tool for effortless PR stack management*

üîó [github.com/yannvanhalewyn/prstack](https://github.com/yannvanhalewyn/prstack)

A CLI and TUI application that embraces the chaos of day-to-day development by dynamically discovering PR stacks instead of forcing rigid pre-defined structures. Unlike traditional tools that require upfront planning, PrStack adapts to whatever shape your development tree has taken.

- Built with Clojure and Babashka for cross-platform compatibility
- Supports Jujutsu (branchless VCS) with Git support coming soon
- Features both interactive TUI and scriptable CLI commands
- Automatic stack synchronization and PR creation

# üé® Passion Projects

Beside the art of crafting beautiful code, I also have ambitions in music and am looking to combine both passions in a personal project.

## Bardistry
*A performance companion app for singer-songwriters*

Helping singer songwriters perform their songs  üé§ https://github.com/yannvanhalewyn/bardistry

A native iOS / Android application optimized for tablets to support singer songwriters manage and perform their setlists and lyrics. The codebase is shared between frontend and backend and uses Biff with XTDB for immutable awesomeness.

## CEV Engine
*MIDI-driven real-time graphics engine*

Real time music visualisations engine üëæ https://github.com/yannvanhalewyn/wolftrap-visuals

An graphics engine build on OpenGL using Clojure that can take MIDI information to generate real time complicated and mathematical visual experiences in support of the music.

## Boyscout
*Interactive pathfinding algorithm visualizer*

Visualize path finding algorithms üß≠ https://yannvanhalewyn.github.io/boyscout

For a simple and quick demo of what my work can look like, try out Boyscout, a pathfinding visualizer.  It's meant for a laptop screen, not optimized for mobile

Tap the Boyscout logo for a neat surprise and a taste of my creativity and attention to detail!
