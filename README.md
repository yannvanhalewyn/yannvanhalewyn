# Hi, I'm Yann üëã

**Let's Build Beautiful Things Together! üöÄ**

Passionate about product development and automation I offer a wide spectrum of knowledge, experience and skills.
From infrastructure to UI/UX. 
From conception to released product

I combine my intuition with my experience to develop simplicity in complex systems in order to produce robust functional solutions. Additionally my passion and empathic qualities are leveraged for optimizing the experience of the end user.

## Miscelaneous jobs

In between I have worked on projects and helped clients develop features in their websites or systems. Some examples are:

# üé® Passion Projects 

Beside the art of crafting beautiful code, I also have ambitions in music and am looking to combine both passions in a personal project.

## Bardistry

Helping singer songwriters perform their songs  üé§ https://github.com/yannvanhalewyn/bardistry

A native iOS / Android application optimized for tablets to support singer songwriters manage and perform their setlists and lyrics. The codebase is shared between frontend and backend and uses Biff with XTDB for immutable awesomeness.

## CEV Engine

Real time music visualisations engine üëæ https://github.com/yannvanhalewyn/wolftrap-visuals

An graphics engine build on OpenGL using Clojure that can take MIDI information to generate real time complicated and mathematical visual experiences in support of the music.

## Realms of Inner Magic 

Build the next generation society üßô https://github.com/yannvanhalewyn/realms-of-inner-magic

A fantasy MMORPG geared towards showing humans an experience of building a society based on unconditional love.

## Boyscout

Visualize path finding algorithms üß≠ https://yannvanhalewyn.github.io/boyscout

For a simple and quick demo of what my work can look like, try out Boyscout, a pathfinding visualizer.  It's meant for a laptop screen, not optimized for mobile

Tap the Boyscout logo for a neat surprise and a taste of my creativity and attention to detail!
